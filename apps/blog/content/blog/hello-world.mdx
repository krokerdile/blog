# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! 👋

This blog is built using:
- **Next.js 15**: For the best performance and developer experience.
- **MDX**: To write content with custom React components.

Here's a simple React component example:

```tsx
function Search({ query }: { query: string }) {
  return <div>Search results for: {query}</div>
}
```

## Features

1.  **MDX Support**: Write JSX inside Markdown.
2.  **Responsive Design**: Works on Mobile and Desktop.
3.  **Fast**: Static generation for great performance.

Stay tuned for more updates!
